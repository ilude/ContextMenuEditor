# Context Menu Editor - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Context Menu Editor is a Windows GUI application that allows users to easily manage, edit, and customize context menu items and startup programs through an intuitive interface.

**Status**: 🚧 **v1.1 IN DEVELOPMENT** - Adding Windows Startup Management  
**v1.0**: ✅ COMPLETED - See Implementation Summary section below

## Product Vision
To provide Windows users with a simple, safe, and comprehensive tool for managing their Windows customizations (context menus and startup programs) without requiring direct registry editing knowledge.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Power users and system administrators who want to customize their Windows experience
- **Secondary**: Software developers who need to manage context menu entries for their applications
- **Tertiary**: General users who want to clean up cluttered context menus

## Core Features

### 1. Context Menu Discovery and Display ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ **File Context Menus**: Displays all context menu items from `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell` and `shellex\ContextMenuHandlers`
- ✅ **Directory Context Menus**: Shows items from `Directory\shell`, `Directory\Background\shell`, and handlers
- ✅ **Drive Context Menus**: Lists items from `Drive\shell` and handlers
- ✅ **Unified Single-View Interface**: Single DataGrid with Type column (File/Directory/Drive/Background) instead of tabs - simpler, more efficient
- ✅ **Grid Display**: Sortable DataGrid with columns: Enabled (checkbox), Type, Menu Text, Key, Publisher, File path
- ✅ **Smart Deduplication**: Shows one entry per program while tracking all registry locations (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and HKEY_CURRENT_USER)
- ✅ **Windows System Filtering**: Automatically filters out built-in Windows programs from System32 using environment variables
- ✅ **Resource String Resolution**: Uses P/Invoke (SHLoadIndirectString) to resolve display names from DLL resources

### 2. Context Menu Management ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ **Enable/Disable Items**: 
  - Toggle via checkbox in the grid with INotifyPropertyChanged for instant visual feedback
  - Select item(s) and use Enable/Disable buttons
  - Uses registry `LegacyDisable` value to preserve entries while making them inactive
  - Applies to **all registry locations** for deduplicated items (both HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and HKEY_CURRENT_USER)
  - Visual feedback: disabled items shown in gray italic text
- ✅ **Delete Items**: 
  - Permanently removes registry keys from all tracked locations
  - Confirmation dialog with warning message
  - Removes item from UI on successful deletion
- ✅ **View Details**: DataGrid displays registry key, program name, menu text, publisher, and file path
- ✅ **Backup to .REG File**: Changed from "Save to text file" to "Backup Registry Entries"
  - Exports all context menu items to a standard Windows .REG file
  - Includes all registry values, subkeys, and command entries
  - Restorable by double-clicking the .REG file
  - Timestamped filename (e.g., `ContextMenuBackup_20251001_143052.reg`)
- ✅ **Multi-Selection**: DataGrid supports Ctrl+Click and Shift+Click for selecting multiple items
- ✅ **UAC Elevation**: Application requires administrator privileges via app.manifest for registry modifications

### 3. Custom Context Menu Creation ⏳ **DEFERRED TO v2.0**
- ⏳ **Add New Items**: Create custom context menu entries (not implemented in v1.0)
- ⏳ **Edit Existing Items**: Modify properties of custom entries (not implemented in v1.0)

**Rationale**: v1.0 focused on core management functionality (view, enable/disable, delete, backup). Custom menu creation requires additional UI complexity and validation, suitable for a future release.

### 3.1 Advanced Features ⏳ **PLANNED FOR v2.0**
- Custom icons from files or system icon library
- Submenu support for nested items
- Conditional display based on file types
- Working directory specification
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Custom context menu creation and editing

### 5. Windows Startup Management 🚧 **IN DEVELOPMENT (v1.1)**
- 🚧 **Separate Tab Interface**: Dedicated "Startup Programs" tab alongside "Context Menus" tab
- 🚧 **Startup Discovery**: Discovers startup items from:
  - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`
  - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`
- 🚧 **Enable/Disable Startup Items**: 
  - Uses Windows 10+ `StartupApproved\Run` mechanism for disable tracking
  - Visual feedback with disabled items shown in gray italic
  - Requires admin rights for system-level items
- 🚧 **Delete Startup Items**: Permanently removes from Run/RunOnce with confirmation
- 🚧 **Backup to .REG File**: Export startup registry entries for restoration
- 🚧 **Grid Display**: Columns: Enabled (checkbox), Name, Publisher, Command, Location (UserRun/SystemRun/etc)
- 🚧 **Windows System Filtering**: Filters out built-in Windows startup programs
- 🚧 **Publisher Detection**: Auto-detects software vendors from common path patterns

### 4. Essential Features ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ **Column Sorting**: DataGrid supports sorting by clicking any column header
- ✅ **Column Width Management**: Menu Text auto-sizes to content, File column takes remaining space
- ✅ **Registry Backup**: "Backup Registry Entries" button exports complete .REG file for restoration
- ✅ **Safety Features**: 
  - Confirmation dialogs for delete operations
  - All registry values preserved in .REG backup files
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Administrator Mode**: app.manifest requires UAC elevation on startup for full registry access
- ✅ **Dark Mode**: Full dark/light theme system with Windows 10/11 title bar integration

## v1.0 Implementation Summary

### What Was Built
Context Menu Editor v1.0 successfully delivers core context menu management functionality with a clean, intuitive interface. The application went through iterative development with continuous user feedback, resulting in several design improvements over the original plan.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Single View Instead of Tabs**
   - **Original Plan**: Separate tabs for Files, Directories, Drives, Background, IE, Scheduled Tasks
   - **Implementation**: Single unified DataGrid with Type column
   - **Rationale**: Simpler, more efficient, allows cross-type sorting and filtering

2. **Backup to .REG Instead of Text**
   - **Original Plan**: Export to text file for documentation
   - **Implementation**: Full .REG file export with all registry values
   - **Rationale**: Provides actual restoration capability, more useful than documentation

3. **Dark Mode as Default**
   - **Not in Original Plan**: Theme system with dark/light toggle
   - **Implementation**: Complete theming with Windows 10/11 title bar integration
   - **Rationale**: Modern UI preference, enhanced user experience

4. **Smart Deduplication**
   - **Challenge**: Same programs registered in multiple registry locations
   - **Solution**: Show one UI entry while tracking all registry locations
   - **Benefit**: Cleaner UI, but operations apply to all instances

5. **Windows System Filtering**
   - **Challenge**: Too many built-in Windows items cluttering the view
   - **Solution**: Filter out programs from Windows/System32 using environment variables
   - **Benefit**: Shows only third-party programs users want to manage

6. **Resource String Resolution**
   - **Challenge**: Menu text showing as "@shell32.dll,-8506" or file paths
   - **Solution**: P/Invoke SHLoadIndirectString to resolve DLL resource strings
   - **Benefit**: User-friendly display names matching actual context menus

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: .NET 8 Windows WPF
- **Pattern**: MVVM with ViewModelBase, RelayCommand, INotifyPropertyChanged
- **Registry**: Microsoft.Win32.Registry, RegistryService with async operations
- **P/Invoke**: SHLoadIndirectString (shlwapi.dll), DwmSetWindowAttribute (dwmapi.dll)
- **Theme System**: ThemeManager singleton with dynamic resource binding
- **Security**: UAC elevation via app.manifest (requireAdministrator)

### Project Structure

└── App.xaml                  # Theme resources and application startup
```

### Code Metrics (Commit 932c0ce)
- **Files**: 19 files
- **Lines of Code**: 1,979 insertions
- **Repository**: git main branch with proper .gitignore

### What Works
✅ Registry discovery from HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and HKEY_CURRENT_USER  
✅ Enable/disable with LegacyDisable registry value  
✅ Delete with confirmation and multi-location support  
✅ Backup to .REG file with all values and subkeys  
✅ Dark/light theme with system title bar integration  
✅ Smart deduplication showing one entry per program  
✅ Windows system program filtering  
✅ Resource string resolution (P/Invoke)  
✅ Visual feedback (gray italic for disabled items)  
✅ UAC elevation for registry access  
✅ Custom application icon  
✅ Column width management (auto-size, flexible)  

### What's Deferred
⏳ Custom context menu creation (Add/Edit new items)  
⏳ Refresh command verification  
⏳ Multi-selection batch operations (UI supports, commands need work)  
⏳ Quick search (Ctrl+F) implementation  
⏳ Advanced features: IE menus, Scheduled Tasks, real-time monitoring  

### Development Philosophy Followed
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency injection, interface segregation
- **Simple Over Complex**: Avoided over-engineering, chose straightforward solutions
- **YAGNI**: Didn't add features not needed for v1.0
- **KISS**: Kept code clean and readable
- **User Feedback Driven**: Iterated based on actual usage feedback

## Conclusion
Context Menu Editor v1.0 successfully provides Windows users with a clean, powerful tool to manage their context menus efficiently and safely, eliminating the need for direct registry editing while maintaining full control over the user experience. The application delivers on its core promise with a focus on simplicity, safety, and usability.

## v1.1 Development Notes (In Progress)

### New Feature: Windows Startup Management

**Goal**: Expand the application to manage Windows startup programs, following the same architectural patterns and UI principles as the context menu management.

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **Separate Tab**: Added "Startup Programs" tab alongside "Context Menus" tab
   - Each tab represents a completely different feature
   - Maintains design principle: unified view within each feature, tabs for separate features
2. **New Models**: `StartupItem` with properties: Name, Command, Publisher, Location, IsEnabled, RegistryPath
3. **New Service**: `StartupService` implementing `IStartupService` for registry operations
   - Discovers items from Run and RunOnce keys (User and System level)
   - Enable/Disable using Windows 10+ `StartupApproved` mechanism
   - Delete operations with confirmation
   - Backup to .REG file format
4. **New ViewModel**: `StartupViewModel` following same pattern as `MainViewModel`
   - ObservableCollection of startup items
   - Enable/Disable/Delete/Backup/Refresh commands
   - Status messages and loading states
5. **New View**: `StartupView` UserControl with same layout as context menu view
   - DataGrid with columns: Enabled, Name, Publisher, Command, Location
   - Action buttons panel on the right
   - Status bar at bottom
6. **Consistent Patterns**: Reuses existing infrastructure
   - ViewModelBase for INotifyPropertyChanged
   - RelayCommand for commands
   - Same styling and theming from App.xaml
   - Similar enable/disable/delete workflows

**Registry Locations**:
- **User Run**: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- **System Run**: `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- **User RunOnce**: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`
- **System RunOnce**: `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`
- **Disable Tracking**: `HKCU/HKLM\...\Explorer\StartupApproved\Run` (Windows 10+)

**Testing Status**: 🚧 In Progress
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ⏳ Runtime testing with admin privileges required
- ⏳ Verify enable/disable functionality
- ⏳ Test delete operations
- ⏳ Validate backup/restore workflow

**Version**: This will be released as v1.1 using semantic versioning (MINOR) marker in commit message.
